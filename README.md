<!-- My Assumptions -->
# Assumptions

1. if an airline is not affiliated with an alliance, do not show none:

   We could show none, or unaffiliated. However, I would then give the user a fourth option to filter by unaffiliated. However, I wanted to keep to the design specs so I opted out of adding these features.

2. Like said in the documents given, I took the liberty to experiment with number cards fit in each row. I used CSS Grid to display the cards, thus allowing for responsive design without any media queries.

<!-- How to Run Locally -->
# Running Locally

0. Prerequisite: you will need to install sass (found here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass). should be able install it by opening up the command terminal and typing npm "install sass"

1. download project 

2. cd into the new folder and type "npm install" This installs the required dependencies.

3. To run the React project: run the command in the command line npm start


<!-- Basic react app instructions -->

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
